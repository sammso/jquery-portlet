= The basic idea =

== Traditional web applicatation ==

On traditional web application, where the application is responsible of whole page. jQuery is used to search from whole page. See below:

== Portal page ==

On other hand on portal page application is only responsible for content on portlet window render area, which doesn't include either portlet headers. In portlet world jQuery search should not return anything else than query result from inside portlet.

On jQuery portlet application logic is encapsulated inside Portlet object, which is extented from portlet object.

{{{
var MyPortlet = function(nameSpace, options) {
                var mThis = $.Portlet.call(this, nameSpace); // This extends your portlet object

                mThis.ready = function() {
                    // this is called when $(document).ready is called.                    
                };
                return mThis;
        };
}}}
